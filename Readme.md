Landslides are a critical natural hazard, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, ecosystems, and human lives, particularly in mountainous and hilly regions. Traditional methods of landslide detection, which often involve on-ground surveys and manual assessments, are not only labor-intensive but also constrained by time and accessibility to remote and hazardous areas. In response to these challenges, this project leverages advanced deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net architecture, to develop an automated solution for landslide detection and mapping using multispectral satellite imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs).

The primary datasets utilized include Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and DEMs from USGS, which together provide crucial indicators such as vegetation loss (NDVI), terrain slope, elevation, and exposed soil. The U-Net model, a specialized convolutional neural network for image segmentation tasks, was trained on the Landslide4Sense dataset, consisting of 3799 training images and 120 test images, with pixel-level labels indicating landslide-prone areas.
Rigorous preprocessing steps, including feature extraction and data augmentation, were undertaken to ensure high-quality input for the model.

The developed model demonstrates exceptional performance with an accuracy of 99.15%, precision of 86.58%, recall of 74.84%, and an F1-score of 80.29%. These metrics underline the modelâ€™s capability to accurately identify landslide-prone regions while maintaining robustness across diverse terrains and image resolutions. The use of skip connections in the U-Net architecture ensures the retention of spatial details, enabling precise segmentation critical for practical applications.

By automating landslide mapping, this project offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring and early warning systems, significantly reducing the reliance on manual intervention. The results also highlight the potential for deploying this approach in disaster management, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. Future work will focus on enhancing real-time processing capabilities and incorporating additional environmental factors such as rainfall and soil type to improve the system's predictive power.

This project marks a significant step forward in leveraging remote sensing and artificial intelligence for disaster risk reduction, showcasing the transformative impact of modern technology in addressing one of the most pressing environmental challenges.
